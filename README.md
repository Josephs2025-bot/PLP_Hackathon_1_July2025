# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website - Hackathon 1 Challenge/July 2025.

Welcome to my personal portfolio Webpage project!  
This webpage was built as a requirement to participate in the **Power Learn Project Hackathon** challenge, for the July 2025 Cohort, which I happen to be part of, with the goal of showcasing my shortly acquired skills in CSS and HTML, and the passion for Technology and Healthcare.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m Joseph Gichuhi, a young Kenyan univesity student currently pursuing Bsc. in Clinical Medicine, from JKUAT. I’m deeply passionate about technology, particularly software development, and I'm on a mission to merge healthcare and tech to improve lives and inspire innovation among the youth.

## 🎯 What Drives Me

My work and deep passion is driven by the belief that real-world problems, especially in healthcare, can be solved through smart, accessible technology. I aim to build tools that empower providers, support patients, and foster youth-led innovation.

## 🎯 My Mission

The main aim is to use software development as a bridge between healthcare and technology, to creat solutions that enhance service delivery, inspire young African minds towards innovation and problem solving, and promote a tech-driven future for the universal health.

## 📚 Educational Background

I am currently persuing my undergraduate degree in JKUAT, to become a Clinical Officer.

This is with no doubt my first degree. 

## 💻 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS

The is what the challenge required of us, but also what I can confidently apply. I just got introduced into the tech-world, as a complete beginner 3 weeks ago. I am excited to be on this amazing journey

## 🛠️ Development Process

This project began with deep reflection and research on how a professional portfolio website should look and feel. I then challenged myself to learn more about HTML and CSS by watching YouTube tutorials to become more familiar with the technologies.

I started by writing the skeleton structure using an HTML file, then styled it using a separate CSS file to give it a clean and visually appealing design. GitHub Copilot was incredibly helpful during the process; it assisted in debugging, offering suggestions, and refining my code.

One of the most challenging parts was working on the finer details, like adding icons, aligning content properly, and shaping images. But I pushed myself to do my best.

After three days of intense focus, several commits, and continuous learning, I was proud to bring this project to life, what you now see here!
